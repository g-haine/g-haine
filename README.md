# Who am I?

Since April 2013, I am Associate Professor in the department DISC of the engineering school [ISAE-SUPARERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr).

# What do I do?

I am currently working on distributed port-Hamiltonian systems and their discretization. See my [google scholar profile](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xqUEnrAAAAAJ).

# Why am I on GitHub?

I am working on a collection of python methods and classes in the [SCRIMP project](https://github.com/g-haine/scrimp), intended to speed up the coding process of structure-preserving discretization of port-Hamiltonian systems.
